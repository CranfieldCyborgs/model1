# A multi-classification model for thoracic disease

## First blood (VGG16_try1.ipynb)

In this file, Zijian has finished the basic data processing of NIH images. For convienent, only 600 images of 14 thoacic desease are adopted to run the model. And he uses the VGG16 model to test the code pipeline.

Next step:
- Increase datasets into 100,000 images
    - Should we delete some rare desease?
    - Add COVID-19 into the datasets
- Deploy the model on high performance computer
- Add other models like, ResNet
